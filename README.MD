# Freedom Scoops Old Repository (Deprecated)
You are currently looking at an old one. The project has been relocated [here](https://github.com/FreedomScoops/FreedomScoops). 

This repository has been deprecated due to corruption or other reasons. It is no longer supported and worked on. 
We may shut this down in the next five months. This just to inform others want is happening here and to relocate the project.

## Reason for Archiving
The repository has been refusing to accept or implement modifications for the past few months. Put me through a great deal of frustration to get it resolved.
I created a new repository and verified that all of my files were working. Yes, it did. I tried a few more things here to try fix it and realized that this repository is just corrupted. 
So I shifted over to my new repository and making it public.

## Relocated URL
It has been moved to a different repository at the same URL, [Here](https://github.com/FreedomScoops/FreedomScoops). 
The files have been updated throughout the last few months, and significant progress has been made on the project.

Anyways, see you over at the new one. Thank you for reading and understanding what's going on. ZNukem
